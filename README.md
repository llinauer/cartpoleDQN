# cartpoleDQN

This repository is a little showcase of how to use the DQN-technique from Reinforcement Learning
in a classic control problem, namely, cartpole.

I created this repository because I was reading Maxim Lapan's book "Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on"
at the time and wanted to apply what I've learned to a different problem than explained in the book.
